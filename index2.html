                    description: "1. Software Defined Networks (SDN) & security: SDN is a new networking paradigm where the data and control \
                        plane are separated, opening new horizons to program networks using a logically centralized controller. However,
                        the controller can also be a security liability for SDNs. Exploring the vulnerabilities of SDN and how to overcome
                        these will be one of the goals of this project. Abusing Software Defined Networks is a good video to watch from Blackhat
                        conference if you are interested in this project.
                        2. Internet of Things (IoT): Currently a hot topic in computer networks security, the Internet of Things is defined by
                        all the “things”, i.e., devices, that are connected to the Internet. New protocols have been created to make communication
                        fast and lightweight. An exciting and unexplored area is to find new vulnerabilities of these devices. Believe it or not,
                        there is a way to search these devices, like a google search for IoT. This is an exciting and widely unexplored area where
                        you may hack devices, mine data from IoT, and connect to the most unusual “things” such as wind turbines and webcameras to
                        mine their data.
                        3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: DDoS attacks although they have been around for a while, have no seized to
                        disturb legitimate services and access. The simplicity and ease of creating a DDoS attack is quite fascinating. According
                        to Darkreading, half of the words enterprises were hit by DDoS. Recently attacks have been dramatically increasing in volume.
                        Finding the source of a DDoS attack and detecting it accurately is an interesting problem that remains widely unsolved."
